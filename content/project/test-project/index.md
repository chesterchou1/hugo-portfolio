> TMBA is an academic student club for business school student, It's been running for over 20 years. Most of its alumni are in financial industry, probably because that's one of the best career choice in last decades. Because of it geolocation, most club members are from the top school in Taipei City, like NTU, NCCU, etc.

This is a <i>personal side project</i> that went for a year long, two semesters and one summer vacation(that I wish I could go back) and with some real efforts. It was kind of like a big deal to me in 2020, I felt like I had to do something that would make some impact back then. Though now that I've graduated for almost 2 years. I still found myself keep looking back at what I did at that time. It gives me some sort of self-assurance, determination to keep going, doing what seems right for me, and sometimes I did find different perspectives after having some real work practices.

### What I know I was doing (and it's the right thing to do)

TL;DR: I took a different marketing strategy from the very beginning when I was in charge. It requires organizational adjustments, which is making *Strategy & Marketing* an official department open for club members, which is good for the whole organization from the operation and talent competition perspective. Thus, several action plans was brought to the table, revised and executed, and reviews on a bi-weekly basis. 

##### 1. Yes, re-positioning:

This is a crucial part of the "Reorganization", and leads to the primary action title that needs to be achieved. I noticed the club  was too focused on finance-related services, where lacked of other functions to serve the club's basic operation (marketing for instance) and strategically important areas but less-related functions that target competitive industries or roles in the job market, like Tech, FMCG, Consulting, etc.. We can also argue its highly-concentrated on financial sector would be the risk given the greater competition in student clubs.

##### 2. Building a newer version of relationship inside the organization:

When I decided to pivot the department of Strategy & Marketing, the relationships changes. Or more accurately speaking, the way I choose to interact with other department directors defines the role of strategy & marketing department. This takes efforts, time and great patience and a little empathy (not to much because I found not many people would think at the same level, they just did not have that awareness and motivation). So I leverage my personal marketing communication and project management skill to help the club achieve better member acquisition, alumni support and offline events monetization through campaign and content marketing. With all these, I got my foundation of our new relationship. </br>

##### 3. Internal marketing for better brand marketing:

The whole point of marketing is to creating values, distributing and fulfilling needs. One thing that we often fail to do something is to simply thought about doing things that seems related or necessary in order to get what we want. i.e. we know brand marketing is a good idea but we just can't suddenly be capable of making some real good shits brand assets. As I mentioned earlier the organization itself focused heavily on the financial segment, which is not a intentional choice but rather a course of nature. But note that this is the one of the traditional industry that doesn't require too much marketing resources as their main economical logic. By the way, the history of marketing function in this organization is quite interesting: We're still covering research contents, and yet the media that carrying those information is changing. The way to attract information is turning to social platforms. Alumni used to utilize the printed material like magazines. They know the media and channel has changed somehow, but most still think in a rather limited marketing perspective. Anyway, it's the last standing evidence to support why we still need marketing function roles in this club. But one thing must accomplish is to enhance cross over the marketing function/ footprints into each department.  

### The real struggle and the real challenges (What I knew I was doing but not sure how it will go)
