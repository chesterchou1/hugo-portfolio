### **Findings**

- **Navigating Uncertainties in the Macro Environment:** The prevailing macro environment is characterized by various uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19, high inflation rates, and geopolitical conflicts. These factors have led to fluctuations in the market, with initial double-digit growth during the pandemic followed by subsequent declines. Currently, the industry is focused on managing and assessing the level of component stocking units. Consequently, stimulating and predicting demand has become increasingly challenging.
- **Sustained Innovation in the Premium Segments:** The demand for laptops is heavily reliant on product innovations, improvements, and effective marketing strategies. The replacement of laptops is primarily driven by advancements in technology and enhanced user experiences. In the consumer market, three key segments have emerged, blurring the category boundaries: 
   1. Gaming: emphasizing performance and immersive experiences in games;
   2. Mobile workstations: providing all-in-one productivity and creativity;
   3. Ultrabooks: offering extreme portability for everyday productivity
- **Emergence of Booming AI Applications and Hybrid Working:** The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the increasing prevalence of hybrid working arrangements have introduced new use cases and opportunities. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) technologies, exemplified by advancements such as ChatGPT and AutoGPT, are revolutionizing the computing landscape. These new use cases have the potential to drive product innovation and stimulate demand. Additionally, the digital workplace services market is projected to reach $93 billion by 2025. Moreover, we are witnessing a notable shift from a predominantly work-from-home (WFH) culture to a hybrid working model.
