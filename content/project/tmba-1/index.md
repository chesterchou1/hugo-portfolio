> For those who are unfamiliar with the student club, TMBA, it is not unusual. TMBA is an academic club that caters to business school students and has been in operation for over 20 years. Many of its alumni have gone on to pursue careers in the financial industry, which has been one of the most popular career choices over the past few decades. Due to its location, the majority of club members come from prestigious universities in Taipei City, such as NTU and NCCU.

### **Introduction**

TMBA is one of the 2 student club that I joined in grad school. I took this as my <i>personal side project</i> that eventually went for a year long, two semesters and one summer vacation. It was kind of like a big deal to me in 2020, and I felt like I had to do something that would make some impact back then. So I did put some real efforts in this "project". Though now that I've graduated for almost 2 years. I still found myself keep looking back at what I did at that time. It gives me some sort of self-assurance, determination to keep going, doing what seems right for me, and sometimes I did find different perspectives after having some real work practices.

### **What I know I was doing (and it's the right thing to do)**

**`TL;DR`** I took a different marketing strategy from the very beginning when I was the only one in charge of this department. My action plans requires organizational adjustments, which is making *Strategy & Marketing* an official department open for club members, where I believe it's good for the whole organization from the operation and talent competition perspective. Thus, several following plans was brought to the table, revised and executed, and reviews on a bi-weekly basis. 

#### **Problem definition: The Organization Problems and Risks**

I noticed the club was too focused on finance-related services, where lacked of other functions to serve the club's basic operation, i.e. marketing, other important areas but less-related functions that target competitive industries or roles in the job market, like Tech, FMCG, Consulting, etc. Our driver of organizational growth should depend on the quality of talent network. The higher quality of the network itself, the higher effectiveness and efficiency it would bring real benefit to the individual talent and the whole organization:
- Young talent at this life stage tend to have higher volatility in terms of career choice, and like to keep thing open until they settle on their life goals;
- We shouldn't be categorizing by industry, but more focus on the fundamental/underlying transferrable skills that a "function" can provide individually and collectively as a club

### **Pre-work: Reposition after evaluation**

In order to assess the club's current state accurately, I conducted a club competitors evaluation at the timespan. This involved analyzing the club's service offerings, organizational structure, and competitive landscape. It became evident that the club's heavy emphasis on finance-related services was limiting its ability to cater to other important functions and attract talent from diverse backgrounds. And counterintuitively, one key component in the club brand name is "MBA", misleading the image of broader aspect of what a MBA club should be. 

The club's narrow focus on finance-related services was not aligned with the broader needs of its members and the competitive/collaborative nature of the job market. Based on the above facts and statement, the effect of repositioning to the whole club should serve the following purposes:   

- By diversifying its service offerings, the club could better support its members' career development and enhance its appeal to a wider range of prospective members. 
- Furthermore, expanding into less-related functions would position the club as a versatile and forward-thinking organization within the student club ecosystem. 
- Last and more important to me, It could solve the problem of lacking some marketing resources internally, to some degree


### **Action taken: Building a newer version of relationship inside the organization**

When I decided to pivot the department of Strategy & Marketing, the relationships changes. Or more accurately speaking, the way I choose to interact with other department directors defines the role of Strategy & Marketing department. This takes efforts, time and great patience and a little empathy (not to much because I found not many people would think at the same level, they just did not have that awareness and motivation). So I leverage my personal marketing communication and project management skill to help the club achieve better member acquisition, alumni support and offline events monetization through campaign and content marketing. With all these, I got my foundation of our new relationship. </br>

### **Action-taken: Internal marketing for better brand marketing**

The whole point of marketing is to creating values, distributing and fulfilling needs. One thing that we often fail to do something is to simply thought about doing things that seems related or necessary in order to get what we want. i.e. we know brand marketing is a good idea but we just can't suddenly be capable of making some real good shits brand assets. As I mentioned earlier the organization itself focused heavily on the financial segment, which is not a intentional choice but rather a course of nature. But note that this is the one of the traditional industry that doesn't require too much marketing resources as their main economical logic. By the way, the history of marketing function in this organization is quite interesting: We're still covering research contents, and yet the media that carrying information is changing. The way to attract information is turning to social platforms. Alumni used to utilize the printed material like magazines. They know the media and channel has changed somehow, but most still think in a rather limited marketing perspective. Anyway, it's the last standing evidence to support why we still need marketing function roles in this club. But one thing must accomplish is to enhance cross over the marketing function/ footprints into each department.

### **The real struggle and the real challenges (What I knew I was doing but not sure how it will go)**

All above is just the beginning. I took about 3 months(the whole summer vacation) to move on to next page, which was where the root cause of the problem was, and happened to be my very reason why I chose to do in the first place, and not thinking about personal interest or opportunity cost.
