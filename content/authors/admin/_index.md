Ever since I discovered my strong interest in data analysis, specifically data visualization, at my senior year in college. My growing passion has driven me to explore a wide range of interesting topics like programming languages, statistics and research/reporting skills. This is where I found the "perfect sweet spot" between business and art. <br>

<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> has been my all-time favorite language to draw outputs since then.
